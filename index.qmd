## Book club meetings {.unnumbered}

-   Each week, a volunteer will present a chapter from the book.

    -   This is the best way to learn the material.

-   Presentations will usually consist of a review of the material, a discussion, and/or a demonstration of the principles presented in that chapter.

-   More information about how to present is available in the GitHub repo.

-   Presentations will be recorded and will be available on the [Data Science Learning Community YouTube Channel](https://dslc.io/youtube).
