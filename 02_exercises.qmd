## 8. This exercise relates to the `College` data set, which can be found in the file `College.csv` on the book website. It contains a number of variables for 777 different universities and colleges in the US. The variables are

- `Private` : Public/private indicator
- `Apps` : Number of applications received
- `Accept` : Number of applicants accepted
- `Enroll` : Number of new students enrolled
- `Top10perc` : New students from top 10 % of high school class
- `Top25perc` : New students from top 25 % of high school class
- `F.Undergrad` : Number of full-time undergraduates
- `P.Undergrad` : Number of part-time undergraduates
- `Outstate` : Out-of-state tuition
- `Room.Board` : Room and board costs
- `Books` : Estimated book costs
- `Personal` : Estimated personal spending
- `PhD` : Percent of faculty with Ph.D.s
- `Terminal` : Percent of faculty with terminal degree
- `S.F.Ratio` : Student/faculty ratio
- `perc.alumni` : Percent of alumni who donate
- `Expend` : Instructional expenditure per student
- `Grad.Rate` : Graduation rate

Before reading the data into `Python`, it can be viewed in Excel or a
text editor.

### (a) Use the `pd.read_csv()` function to read the data into `Python`. Call the loaded data `college`. Make sure that you have the directory set to the correct location for the data.

```{python}
college = pd.read_csv('ISLP_data/College.csv')
college
```


### (b) Look at the data used in the notebook by creating and running a new cell with just the code `college` in it. You should notice that the first column is just the name of each university in a column named something like `Unnamed: 0`. We donâ€™t really want `pandas` to treat this as data. However, it may be handy to have these names for later. Try the following commands and similarly look at the resulting data frames:



```{python}

college2 = pd.read_csv('ISLP_data/College.csv', index_col=0)
#college2

college3 = college.rename({'Unnamed: 0': 'college'},
  axis=1)
#college3

college3 = college3.set_index('college')
#college3
```


This has used the first column in the file as an `index` for the data frame. This means that `pandas` has given each row a name corresponding to the appropriate university. Now you should see that the first data column is `Private`. Note that the names of the colleges appear on the left of the table. We also introduced a new python object above: a *dictionary*, which is specified by `(key, value)` pairs. Keep your modified version of the data with the following:

```{python}
college = college3
college
```

### (c) Use the `describe()` method to produce a numerical summary of the variables in the data set.

```{python}

college.describe()

```



### (d) Use the `pd.plotting.scatter_matrix()` function to produce a scatterplot matrix of the first columns `[Top10perc, Apps, Enroll]`. Recall that you can reference a list C of columns of a data frame `A` using `A[C]`.


```{python}
#fig, ax = subplots(figsize=(8, 8))
pd.plotting.scatter_matrix(college[['Top10perc','Apps','Enroll']])
#plt.show()
```



### (e) Use the boxplot() method of college to produce side-by-side boxplots of Outstate versus Private.

```{python}

```


### (f) Create a new qualitative variable, called Elite, by binning the Top10perc variable into two groups based on whether or not the proportion of students coming from the top 10% of their high school classes exceeds 50%.

```{python}
college['Elite'] = pd.cut(college['Top10perc'],
  [0,0.5,1],
  labels=['No', 'Yes'])
```



Use the `value_counts()` method of `college['Elite']` to see how many elite universities there are. Finally, use the `boxplot()` method again to produce side-by-side boxplots of `Outstate` versus `Elite`.


```{python}
college['Elite'].value_counts()
```

```{r}

```


### (g) Use the `plot.hist()` method of `college` to produce some histograms with difering numbers of bins for a few of the quantitative variables. The command `plt.subplots(2, 2)` may be useful: it will divide the plot window into four regions so that four plots can be made simultaneously. By changing the arguments you can divide the screen up in other combinations.

```{python}

```


### (h) Continue exploring the data, and provide a brief summary of what you discover.

```{python}

```



## 9. This exercise involves the `Auto` data set studied in the lab. Make sure that the missing values have been removed from the data.

```{python}

Auto = pd.read_csv('ISLP_data/Auto.csv',
                    na_values=['?'])
Auto

```


### (a) Which of the predictors are quantitative, and which are qualitative?

Mpg, Displacement, Horsepower, Weight and Acceleration are quantitative. Cylinders, Year, Origin, and Name are qualitative.

```{python}
Auto.info()
```

```{python}
Auto['cylinders'] = Auto['cylinders'].astype('object') 
Auto['cylinders']
```


### (b) What is the range of each quantitative predictor? You can answer this using the `min()` and `max()` methods in `numpy`. 

```{python}
mpg_min = Auto['mpg'].min( )
mpg_max = Auto['mpg'].max( )

print('The min and max miles per gallon are', (mpg_min, mpg_max))
```


```{python}
dsp_min = Auto['displacement'].min( )
dsp_max = Auto['displacement'].max( )

print('The min and max displacement are', (dsp_min, dsp_max))
```


```{python}
hpwr_min = Auto['horsepower'].min( )
hpwr_max = Auto['horsepower'].max( )

print('The min and max horsepower are', (hpwr_min, hpwr_max))
```

```{python}
wt_min = Auto['weight'].min( )
wt_max = Auto['weight'].max( )

print('The min and max weights are', (wt_min, wt_max))
```

```{python}
acc_min = Auto['acceleration'].min( )
acc_max = Auto['acceleration'].max( )

print('The min and max accelerations are', (acc_min, acc_max))
```

### (c) What is the mean and standard deviation of each quantitative predictor?


```{python}

mpg_mean = Auto['mpg'].mean( )
mpg_sd = Auto['mpg'].std( )

print('The mean and standard deviation of miles per gallon are', mpg_mean,'and', mpg_sd)
```


```{python}
dsp_mean = Auto['displacement'].mean( )
dsp_sd = Auto['displacement'].std( )

print('The mean and standard deviation of weight are', dsp_mean,'and', dsp_sd)
```


```{python}
hpwr_mean = Auto['horsepower'].mean( )
hpwr_sd = Auto['horsepower'].std( )

print('The mean and standard deviation of horsepower are', hpwr_mean,'and', hpwr_sd)
```

```{python}
wt_mean = Auto['weight'].mean( )
wt_sd = Auto['weight'].std( )

print('The mean and standard deviation of weight are', wt_mean,'and', wt_sd)
```

```{python}
acc_mean = Auto['acceleration'].mean( )
acc_sd = Auto['acceleration'].std( )

print('The mean and standard deviation of acceleration are', acc_mean,'and', acc_sd)
```


### (d) Now remove the 10th through 85th observations. What is the range, mean, and standard deviation of each predictor in the subset of the data that remains?

```{python}
Auto_new = Auto.drop(Auto.index[10:85])
Auto_new
```


```{python}
mpg_min = Auto_new['mpg'].min( )
mpg_max = Auto_new['mpg'].max( )

print('The min and max miles per gallon of the subsetted data are', (mpg_min, mpg_max))

mpg_mean = Auto_new['mpg'].mean( )
mpg_sd = Auto_new['mpg'].std( )

print('The mean and standard deviation of miles per gallon of the subsetted data are', mpg_mean,'and', mpg_sd)
```


```{python}
dsp_min = Auto_new['displacement'].min( )
dsp_max = Auto_new['displacement'].max( )

print('The min and max displacement of the subsetted data are', (dsp_min, dsp_max))

dsp_mean = Auto_new['displacement'].mean( )
dsp_sd = Auto_new['displacement'].std( )

print('The mean and standard deviation of weight of the subsetted data are', dsp_mean,'and', dsp_sd)
```


```{python}
hpwr_min = Auto['horsepower'].min( )
hpwr_max = Auto['horsepower'].max( )

print('The min and max horsepower of the subsetted data are', (hpwr_min, hpwr_max))

hpwr_mean = Auto['horsepower'].mean( )
hpwr_sd = Auto['horsepower'].std( )

print('The mean and standard deviation of horsepower of the subsetted data are', hpwr_mean,'and', hpwr_sd)
```

```{python}
wt_min = Auto['weight'].min( )
wt_max = Auto['weight'].max( )

print('The min and max weights of the subsetted data are', (wt_min, wt_max))

wt_mean = Auto['weight'].mean( )
wt_sd = Auto['weight'].std( )

print('The mean and standard deviation of weight of the subsetted data are', wt_mean,'and', wt_sd)
```

```{python}
acc_min = Auto['acceleration'].min( )
acc_max = Auto['acceleration'].max( )

print('The min and max accelerations of the subsetted data are', (acc_min, acc_max))

acc_mean = Auto['acceleration'].mean( )
acc_sd = Auto['acceleration'].std( )

print('The mean and standard deviation of acceleration of the subsetted data are', acc_mean,'and', acc_sd)
```
