## What is classification?
> Predicting a qualitative response for an observation can be referred to as classifying that observation, since it involves assigning the observation to a category, or class.

## Some questions that can be solved with classification
- A person arrives at the emergency room with a set of symptoms that could possibly be attributed to one of three medical conditions. Which of the three conditions does the individual have?
- An online banking service must be able to determine whether or not a transaction being performed on the site is fraudulent, on the basis of the  user’s IP address, past transaction history, and so forth.
- On the basis of DNA sequence data for a number of patients with and without a given disease, a biologist would like to figure out which DNA mutations are deleterious (disease-causing) and which are not.

## Why not linear regression?

- Linear regression should not:
    - be used to predict a qualitative or categorical variable with more than 2 levels that does not have a natural ordering
    - be used to predict a qualitative or categorical variable with more than 2 levels that does not have a reasonably similar gap between each level. 
- If your qualitative outcome variable only has 2 levels you could recode it as a dummy variable with 0/1 coding. This is not recommmended because the probability estimates will probably not be meaningful. 


## Logistic Regression
> Rather than modeling this response $Y$ directly, logistic regression models the probability that $Y$ belongs to a particular category

Classification using the `Default` data. Left: Estimated probability of `default` using linear regression. Some estimated probabilities are negative! The orange ticks indicate the 0/1 values coded for `default` (`No` or `Yes`). Right: Predicted probabilities of `default` using logistic regression. All probabilities lie between 0 and 1.

##

- ${\beta_1}$ in linear regression is the average change in $Y$ associated with a one-unit increase in $X$. In a logistic regression model, increasing $X$ by one unit changes the log odds by ${\beta_1}$
- regardless of the value of $X$, if ${\beta_1}$ is positive then increasing $X$ will be associated with increasing $p(X)$, and if ${\beta_1}$ is negative then increasing $X$ will be associated with decreasing $p(X)$.

$$p(X) = β_0 + β_1X \space \Longrightarrow {Linear \space regression}$$
$$p (X) =  \frac{e^{\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}X}}{1 + e^{\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}X}} \space \Longrightarrow {Logistic \space function}$$


## Maximum Likelihood
Using maximum likelihood, the regression coefficients are chosen based on the probability estimates being as close as possible to the observed response of $Y$ for each case in the training data.

> The estimates $\hat{\beta_0}$ and $\hat{\beta_1}$ are chosen to maximize this likelihood function.

## Making Predictions

Once we have our estimated coefficients we can input any value of $X$ into the model and predict the probability of $Y$. Using the bank example, we can predict `default` based on any `balance`. 


$$\hat{p}(X) = \frac{e^{\hat{\beta}_{0} + \hat{\beta}_{1}X}}{1 + e^{\hat{\beta}_{0} + \hat{\beta}_{1}X}} 
= \frac{e^{-10.6513 + 0.0055 \times 1000}}{1 + e^{-10.6513 + 0.0055 \times 1000}} 
= 0.00576$$


## Multiple Logistic Regression
The equation for simple logistic regression can be rewritten to include coefficient estimates for $p$ predictors. 

$$\log \biggl(\frac{p(X)}{1- p(X)}\bigg) = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}X_1 + ... + \beta_{p}X_p$$
$$p(X) = \frac{e^{\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}X_1 + ... + \beta_{p}X_p}}{1 + e^{\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}X_1 + ... + \beta_{p}X_p}}$$

## Multinomial  Logistic Regression
- This is used in the setting where K > 2 classes. In multinomial, we select a single class to serve as the baseline.

- However, the interpretation of the coefficients in a multinomial logistic regression model must be done with care, since it is tied to the choice of baseline. 

- Alternatively, you can use `Softmax coding, where we treat all K classes symmetrically, and assume that for k = 1, . . . ,K, rather than selecting a baseline. This means, we estimate coefficients for all K classes, rather than estimating coefficients for K − 1 classes. 


## Generative Models for Classification
>  model the distribution of the predictors X separately in each of the response classes (i.e. for each value of Y ).


## Again, why not logistic regression?
- When there is substantial separation between the two classes, the parameter estimates for the logistic regression model are surprisingly unstable. 

- If the distribution of the predictors X is approximately normal in each of the classes and the sample size is small, then the generative modelling may be more accurate than logistic regression.

- Generative modelling can be naturally extended to the case of more than two response classes. 


## Common notation in generative models

- $\pi_k$ = overall or prior probability that a randomly chosen observation comes from the prior kth class

- $f_k(X) \equiv \Pr(X \mid Y = k)$ = the density function of $X$ for an observation that comes from the $k$th class. It is relatively large if there is a high probability that an observation in the $k$th class has $X \approx x$, and $f_k(X)$ is small if it is very unlikely that an observation in the $k$th class has $X \approx x$.

- $p_k(X)$ is the probability that the observation belongs to the kth class, given the predictor value for that observation.


## 3 classifiers to approximate the Bayes classifier

- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) - normal distribution, covariance matrix that is common to all $K$ classes
- Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) - normal distribution, covariance matrix that is NOT common to all $K$ classes
- Naive Bayes - uncorrelated predictors, small n, no distribution assumption



## Linear Bayes decision boundaries
<span style="font-size: 60%;"> **Scenario 1:** 20 training observations for each class, uncorrelated normal distribution predictors </span>

<span style="font-size: 60%;"> **Scenario 2:** Similar to scenario 1, but predictors had a correlation of -0.5 </span>

<span style="font-size: 60%;"> **Scenario 3:** Substantial negative correlation, and predictors were generated from the t-distribution with 50 trainings observations for each class </span>

## Poisson Regression

### Again, why not linear regression?
Similarly to predicting the probability of qualitative variables, negative predictions of count data are not meaningful.

Right: The log of the number of bikers is now displayed on the y-axis.</span>


## Poisson distribution
**Poisson distribution** is typically used to model counts. When $Y$ is neither quantitative (sales) nor qualitative (whether or not someone will default on a loan). In a poisson distribution, the variance is the same as the mean. 

> the larger the mean of $Y$, the larger its variance. 

## Poisson regression

>  rather  than modeling the number of bikers, $Y$, as a Poisson distribution with a fixed mean value like $\lambda$ = 5, we would like to allow the mean to vary as a function of the covariates.


## Generalized Linear Models

Linear, logistic and Poisson are three examples of regression models that are known as a generalized linear model (GLM).

Each of them uses predictors $X$ to predict a response $Y$. 

>  In general, we can perform a regression by modeling the response $Y$ as coming from a particular member of the exponential family, and then transforming the mean of the response so that the transformed mean is a linear function of the predictors... Any regression approach that follows this very general recipe is
known as a **generalized linear model**
