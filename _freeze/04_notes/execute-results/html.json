Which of the three conditions does the individual have?\n- An online banking service must be able to determine whether or not a transaction being performed on the site is fraudulent, on the basis of the  user’s IP address, past transaction history, and so forth.\n- On the basis of DNA sequence data for a number of patients with and without a given disease, a biologist would like to figure out which DNA mutations are deleterious (disease-causing) and which are not.\n\n### Why not linear regression?\n\n- Linear regression should not be used to predict a qualitative or categorical variable with more than 2 levels that does not have a natural ordering\n- Linear regression should not be used to predict a qualitative or categorical variable with more than 2 levels that does not have a reasonably similar gap between each level. \n- If your qualitative outcome variable only has 2 levels you could recode it as a dummy variable with 0/1 coding. This is not recommmended because the probability estimates will probably not be meaningful, for example have negative probabilities. \n- A linear regression model to predict the relationship between `default` and `balance` leads to negative probabilities of default for bank balances close to zero.\n\nExamples of categorical variables that are not appropriate as outcome variables for linear regression?\n\n## Logistic Regression\n> Rather than modeling this response $Y$ directly, logistic regression models the probability that $Y$ belongs to a particular category\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Figure 4.2](images/04-fig4_2.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nClassification using the `Default` data. Left: Estimated probability of `default` using linear regression. Some estimated probabilities are negative! The orange ticks indicate the 0/1 values coded for `default` (`No` or `Yes`). Right: Predicted probabilities of `default` using logistic regression. All probabilities lie between 0 and 1.\n\n- logistic regression uses a logistic function which gives probability estimates between 0 and 1 for all values of $X$. \n- a logistic function will always produce an S-shaped curve, probabilities will come close to but never below zero and close but never above one.\n- probability of response $Y$ can be predicted based on any value of $X$. \n- ${\\beta_1}$ in linear regression is the average change in $Y$ associated with a one-unit increase in $X$. By contrast, in a logistic regression model, increasing $X$ by one unit changes the log odds by ${\\beta_1}$\n- regardless of the value of $X$, if ${\\beta_1}$ is positive then increasing $X$ will be associated with increasing $p(X)$, and if ${\\beta_1}$ is negative then increasing $X$ will be associated with decreasing $p(X)$.\n\n\n$$p(X) = β_0 + β_1X \\space \\Longrightarrow {Linear \\space regression}$$\n$$p (X) =  \\frac{e^{\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}X}}{1 + e^{\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}X}} \\space \\Longrightarrow {Logistic \\space function}$$\n\n\n### Maximum Likelihood\nUsing maximum likelihood, the regression coefficients are chosen based on the probability estimates being as close as possible to the observed response of $Y$ for each case in the training data.\n\n> The estimates $\\hat{\\beta_0}$ and $\\hat{\\beta_1}$ are chosen to maximize this likelihood function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![For the `Default` data, estimated coefficients of the logistic regression model that predicts the probability of `default` using `balance`. A one-unit increase in `balance` is associated with an increase in the log odds of `default` by 0.0055 units.](images/04-tab4_1.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Making Predictions\n\nOnce we have our estimated coefficients we can input any value of $X$ into the model and predict the probability of $Y$. Using the bank example, we can predict `default` based on any `balance`. \n\n\n$$\\hat{p}(X) = \\frac{e^{\\hat{\\beta}_{0} + \\hat{\\beta}_{1}X}}{1 + e^{\\hat{\\beta}_{0} + \\hat{\\beta}_{1}X}} \n= \\frac{e^{-10.6513 + 0.0055 \\times 1000}}{1 + e^{-10.6513 + 0.0055 \\times 1000}} \n= 0.00576$$\n\n### Qualitative predictors\nInstead of a quantitative predictor like credit balance, we could use a qualitative, or categorical, variable, like whether or not someone is a student, to predict whether or not someone will default. \n\n## Multiple Logistic Regression\nThe equation for simple logistic regression can be rewritten to include coefficient estimates for $p$ predictors. \n\n$$\\log \\biggl(\\frac{p(X)}{1- p(X)}\\bigg) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}X_1 + ... + \\beta_{p}X_p$$\n$$p(X) = \\frac{e^{\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}X_1 + ... + \\beta_{p}X_p}}{1 + e^{\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}X_1 + ... + \\beta_{p}X_p}}$$\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Figure 4.3](images/04-fig4_3.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nConfounding in the Default data. Left: Default rates are shown for students (orange) and non-students (blue). The solid lines display  default rate as a function of balance, while the horizontal broken lines display the overall default rates. Right: Boxplots of balance for students (orange) and non-students (blue) are shown.\n\n## Multinomial  Logistic Regression\n- This is used in the setting where K > 2 classes. In multinomial, we select a single class to serve as the baseline.\n\n- However, the interpretation of the coefficients in a multinomial logistic regression model must be done with care, since it is tied to the choice of baseline. \n\n- Alternatively, you can use `Softmax coding, where we treat all K classes symmetrically, and assume that for k = 1, . . . ,K, rather than selecting a baseline. This means, we estimate coefficients for all K classes, rather than estimating coefficients for K − 1 classes. \n\n\n## Generative Models for Classification\n>  model the distribution of the predictors X separately in each of the response classes (i.e. for each value of Y ).\n\n\n**Why not logistic regression?**\n\n- When there is substantial separation between the two classes, the parameter estimates for the logistic regression model are surprisingly unstable. \n\n- If the distribution of the predictors X is approximately normal in each of the classes and the sample size is small, then the generative modelling may be more accurate than logistic regression.\n\n- Generative modelling can be naturally extended to the case of more than two response classes. \n\n\n\n\n$\\pi_k$ = overall or prior probability that a randomly chosen observation comes from the prior kth class\n\n$f_k(X) \\equiv \\Pr(X \\mid Y = k)$ = the density function of $X$ for an observation that comes from the $k$th class. It is relatively large if there is a high probability that an observation in the $k$th class has $X \\approx x$, and $f_k(X)$ is small if it is very unlikely that an observation in the $k$th class has $X \\approx x$.\n\n$p_k(X)$ is the probability that the observation belongs to the kth class, given the predictor value for that observation.\n\n\n### 3 classifiers to approximate the Bayes classifier\n\n- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)\n- Quadratic Discriminant Analysis\n- Naive Bayes\n\n\n## Comparison of classification methods\n\n### Analytic comparison\n\n\n### Empirical comparison\n\n6 scenarios to empirically compaire the performance of logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), naive Bayes, and K Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Each of the 6 different scenarios was a binary classification problem with 2 quantitative predictors. \n\nLinear Bayes decision boundaries\n\n**Scenario 1:** 20 training observations for each class, uncorrelated normal distribution predictors\n\n**Scenario 2:** Similar to scenario 1, but predictors had a correlation of -0.5.\n\n**Scenario 3:** Substantial negative correlation, and predictors were generated from the t-distribution with 50 trainings observations for each class. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Figure 4.11 Boxplots of the test error rates for each of the linear scenarios described in the main text.](images/04-fig4_11.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nNon-linear Bayes decision boundaries\n\n**Scenario 4:** normal distribution,  correlation of 0.5 between the predictors in the first class, and correlation of 0.5 between the predictors in the second class\n\n**Scenario 5:** normal distribution with uncorrelated predictors, responses were sampled from the logistic function applied to a complicated non-linear function of the predictors\n\n**Scenario 6:** normal distribution with a different diagonal covariance matrix for each class and a very small sample size of 6 in each class\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Figure 4.12 Boxplots of the test error rates for each of the non-linear scenarios described in the main text.](images/04-fig4_12.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Poisson Regression\n\n### Why not linear regression?\nSimilarly to predicting the probability of qualitative variables, negative predictions of count data are not meaningful. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Figure 4.13](images/04-fig4_13.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLeft: The coefficients associated with the month of the year. Bike usage is highest in the spring and fall, and lowest in the winter. Right: The coefficients associated with the hour of the day. Bike usage is highest during peak commute times, and lowest overnight.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Figure 4.14](images/04-fig4_14.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nLeft: On the Bikeshare dataset, the number of bikers is displayed on the y-axis, and the hour of the day is displayed on the x-axis. For the most part, as the mean number of bikers increases, so does the variance in the number of bikers, violating the assumption of homoscedasticity. A smoothing spline fit is shown in green. Right: The log of the number of bikers is now displayed on the y-axis.\n\n\n### Poisson distribution\n**Poisson distribution** is typically used to model counts. When $Y$ is neither quantitative (sales) nor qualitative (whether or not someone will default on a loan). In a poisson distribution, the variance is the same as the mean. \n\n> the larger the mean of $Y$, the larger its variance. \n\n### Poisson regression\n\n>  rather  than modeling the number of bikers, $Y$, as a Poisson distribution with a fixed mean value like $\\lambda$ = 5, we would like to allow the mean to vary as a function of the covariates.\n\n\n## Generalized Linear Models\n\nLinear, logistic and Poisson are three examples of regression models that are known as a generalizede linear model (GLM).\n\nEach of them uses predictors $X$ to predict a response $Y$. \n\n>  In general, we can perform a regression by modeling the response $Y$ as coming from a particular member of the exponential family, and then transforming the mean of the response so that the transformed mean is a linear function of the predictors",
