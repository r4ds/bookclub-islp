It makes connections between the fields of statistics, linear algebra and functional analysis.\nIn particular, the Statistical learning theory deals with the problem of finding a predictive function based on data and this is what is best known as supervised learning, in this book we will see more than just theory, as we will deal with unsupervised learning as well as making practical applications.\n\nSupervised: “Building a model to predict an output from inputs.”\n\nPredict wage from age, education, and year.\nPredict market direction from previous days' performance.\n\nUnsupervised: Inputs but no specific outputs, find relationships and structure.\n\nIdentify clusters within cancer cell lines."
